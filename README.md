## Progression Description

This mod alters progress throughout Minecolonies to conform to TerraFirmaCraft's gameplay. The main overview is as follows:

 - Paleolithic: You just spawned as a simple hunter/gatherer. You aren't prepared to start building a settlement as your basic survival needs haven't been met (food, water, etc).
 - Neolithic: Your first steps in a settlement. You're expected to have stone tools, basic materials (clay, thatch, logs, mud bricks, etc.), and be able to start simple farming. At this point you can start building a very simple settlement (level 1 town hall, builders hut, etc.).
 - Chalcolithic: The next tier up. You've unlocked basic copper tools and elementary level woodworking. You can build larger structures and expand your settlement with larger buildings. 
 - Bronze Age: You and your colony can use Bronze tools. At this point you can build a fairly successful colony. However, the building materials will progressively become more and more eccentric. As your technology improves, you'll be expected to progress through both exploration and expansion.
 - Iron Age: This is medieval minecraft. You're able to expand your kingdom with better tools, metal smithing techniques, and more. Your thirst for knowledge requires even the most precious materials in the game.
 - Steel Age: You've now unlocked most of the technology in the game. Your colony should be a large city at this point and have little left to do, besides the far reaches of alchemy and research.
 - Colored Steel: Bonus tier. You've beaten the game. You play god by moving water at your heart's content.
