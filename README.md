## Progression Description

This mod alters progress throughout Minecolonies to conform to TerraFirmaCraft's gameplay. The main overview is as follows:

 - Paleolithic: You just spawned as a simple hunter/gatherer. You aren't prepared to start building a settlement as your basic survival needs haven't been met (food, water, etc).
 - Neolithic: Your first steps in a settlement. You're expected to have stone tools, basic materials (clay, thatch, logs, mud bricks, etc.), and be able to start simple farming. At this point you can start building a very simple settlement (level 1 town hall, builders hut, etc.).
 - Chalcolithic: The next tier up. You've unlocked basic copper tools and elementary level woodworking. You can build larger structures and expand your settlement with larger buildings.
